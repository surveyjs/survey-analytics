# Chart Types

SurveyJS Dashboard visualizes survey data using different types of charts. This help topic gives a brief overview of the chart types included in the library. Each description includes illustrations and a list of supported question types.

## Bar Chart

A bar chart visualizes categorical data with rectangular bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. SurveyJS Dashboard supports vertical and horizontal bar charts.

## Pie Chart

A pie chart is a circular graph divided into slices that represent proportions of a whole. Pie charts are great for visualizing how each category contributes to a total. They work best with fewer categories because a bigger number of slices can make chart interpretation difficult.

[View Demo](https://surveyjs.io/dashboard/examples/how-to-customize-plotly-gauge-chart-javascript/ (linkStyle))

## Bullet Chart

A bullet chart visualizes a single number on a horizontal strip. Similar to a gauge, it displays the average of a dataset, with the value indicated by a bar. The strip displays scale marks along its length, similar to the scale on a gauge's semicircle.

<img src="images/chart-types-bullet.png" width="557" height="475" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: Bullet chart">

Bullet charts are supported by the following question types:

- [Single-Line Input](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/numeric-entry-question/) with [`inputType`](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/api-reference/text-entry-question-model#inputType) set to `"number"`
- [Rating Scale](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/rating-scale/)
- [Expression](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/expression-question-for-dynamic-form-calculations/)

## Stacked Bar Chart

A stacked bar chart displays each bar divided into multiple segments that visualize the percentage contribution of each category. The total length of bars represents 100%. Stacked bar charts are useful for showing the breakdown of a total into its individual components.

<img src="images/chart-types-stacked-bar.png" width="718" height="392" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: Stacked bar chart">

Stacked bar charts are supported by the following question types:

- [Single-Select Matrix](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/single-selection-matrix-table-question/)

## Word Cloud

A word cloud (also "text cloud" or "tag cloud") visualizes textual data by adjusting the size of words based on their frequency. Word clouds are useful for analyzing large collections of textual data as they provide an immediate and illustrative summary of it.

<img src="images/chart-types-word-cloud.png" width="678" height="503" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: Word cloud">

Word clouds are supported by the following question types:

- [Single-Line Input](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/text-entry-question/)
- [Long Text](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/add-open-ended-question-to-a-form/)
- [Multiple Textboxes](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/multiple-text-box-question/)

## Text Table

A text table is a visualization type that displays textual data in a simple table, without applying any data aggregation.

<img src="images/chart-types-table.png" width="677" height="409" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: Table visualizer">

Text tables are supported by the following question types:

## Statistics Table

A statistics table is a visualization type that aggregates data from single- and multi-select questions and displays it in a tabular format.

<img src="images/chart-types-statistics-table.png" width="719" height="572" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: Statistics table">

Statistics tables are supported by the following question types:

- [Radio Button Group](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/single-select-radio-button-group/)
- [Checkboxes](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/create-checkboxes-question-in-javascript/)
- [Dropdown](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/create-dropdown-menu-in-javascript/)

## NPS Visualizer

An NPS visualizer is a chart designed specifically for Net Promoter Score (NPS) questions. NPS measures customer loyalty and identifies business growth opportunities. Respondents rate how likely they are to recommend your product or service on a scale from 0 to 10.

- Promoters (score 9-10) are most likely keep buying your product and bring new customers. 
- Passives (score 7-8) are overall satisfied with your product but may switch to your competitors if they come across a more attractive offering. 
- Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy with your product and may damage your brand through negative word-of-mouth. 

To calculate the NPS, the percentage of detractors should be subtracted from that of promoters.

<img src="images/chart-types-nps.png" width="778" height="225" alt="SurveyJS Dashboard: NPS visualizer">

The NPS visualizer is supported only by [Rating Scale](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/rating-scale/) questions, standalone or used within a [Multi-Select Matrix](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/multi-select-matrix-question/), [Dynamic Matrix](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/dynamic-matrix-add-new-rows/), or [Dynamic Panel](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/duplicate-group-of-fields-in-form/). This visualizer is disabled by default. To enable it, use the following code:

```js
import { VisualizationManager, NpsVisualizer } from "survey-analytics";

VisualizationManager.registerVisualizer("rating", NpsVisualizer);
```
